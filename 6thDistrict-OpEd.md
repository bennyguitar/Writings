More meaning, less meandering please.

Whenever any one of Alabama's 6th district candidates appear on television, a Rube Goldberg reaction starts as my body embarks on a journey that begins with a sigh and always ends with rolling eyes. Their rhetoric is nuanced, but effectively all the same. The dead horse beats itself.

All of the potential congressmen are going to clean up Washington, gosh darnit! Each of the them, it seems, want to ditch their tailored suits and don a maid's outfit to vacuum the money out of this nation's capital. But wait, they're also going to balance the budget! Soon the candidates appear in Roman garb weighing a giant word, "FEDERALBUDGET", while the coliseum crowd erupts in gluttonous chee--

Snap out of it Ben; this is serious!

These pesky daydreams can only subside when my mental appetite becomes satiated. I need to know how you will accomplish your promises, not vague generalizations of party talking points. Give me something I can hang my thinking cap on. I agree that Washington is in need of a little Spring cleaning, and I also agree that our budget is too large to maintain financially. What are you going to do about it, specifically?

Maybe I'm an atypical voter, but I'm hungry for answers. I ordered Seared Foie Details off of the menu and you've all served me a double portion of Buzzword Soup. I just hope the steam won't fog this district's glasses.
